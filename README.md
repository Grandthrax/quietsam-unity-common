## Quietsam Unity Common

Shared C# utilities, extensions, and Editor tooling reused across my Unity projects.

## How to use in your project


### Unity Package Manager via Git 
In any Unity project:

- Open Package Manager → Add package from git URL…
- Use a URL like:

```
https://github.com/grandthrax/quietsam-unity-common.git
```

You can pin to:
- a tag: `#v0.1.0`
- a branch: `#master`
- a commit: `#<commit-hash>`

To update, bump the tag/commit or use Package Manager's Update.
